Shemnue 1 and 2 Launcher for proton.

This minimalist code is able to replace the default game launcher for shemnue
because the default launcher wont work under linux/wine

Compile Laucher.cpp using mingw

x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc-win32 Launcher.cpp -o SteamLauncher.exe

Then repace the launcher in game folder with SteamLauncher.exe
